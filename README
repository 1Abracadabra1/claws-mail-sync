This module is a Claws Mail plugin for OpenSync. It
can be used to connect to Claws Mail in a synchronisation
group. It supports address data and contact events.

Claws Mail has to be running while the synchronisation is
performed. Also, the OpenSync plugin for Claws Mail has
to be loaded.

This is alpha software. It requires at least an OpenSync
version of the 0.3 branch. Be sure to back up your data
on all sides of the sync group before trying this out.
